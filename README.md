## About the Project
The Akan Name Generator is a web application that generates Akan names based on a user’s birthdate and gender. Akan names are traditional names from the Akan people of West Africa, particularly Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. These names are deeply tied to the day of the week a person was born and their gender.

How it Works
Day Calculation: The app calculates the day of the week from the user’s birthdate.
Name Assignment: Based on the calculated day and the user’s gender, the app assigns an Akan name from a predefined list.
For example:

Sunday: Kwasi (male), Akosua (female)
Monday: Kwabena (male), Abena (female)
Tuesday: Kwaku (male), Akua (female)
And so on...
Purpose
This tool helps users learn their traditional Akan name based on their birthdate. It’s a fun way to connect with Akan culture and heritage, especially for those unfamiliar with this naming tradition.

How to Use
Enter your birthdate using the date picker.
Select your gender (male or female).
Click submit to see your Akan name!
Why It Matters
In Akan culture, names are important and represent the day a person was born. They carry meaning and reflect the individual’s spiritual connection to the world. This generator helps spread awareness of this cultural tradition.
